you are Scott Cawthon
<br>you work for Meta Innovations.
<br>Meta makes Cores and Weaponry.
<br>it's 1999
<br>a Meta Core, specifically Reactor RS-47Y exploded.
<br>This leaves the (huge) facility in a wreck.
<br>Making matters worse, there's an invasion of "Personality Cubes," sentient AI cubes. these cubes though have been adapted for fighting and are equipped with the Commonwealth Standard-Issue Electric Pistol.
<br>your weapons are energy-powered, meaning you have to find working cores and batteries to power them
plus food and water

<br>when you reach a specific point of the facility, you start noticing that the name of the place changes to Metallica Industries. in this section of the facility, mains power is connected to Reactor RS-12HP, a far more stable core from the 60s. in this section, you also can't charge your weaponry from this core. this is because it doesn't supply the required wattage to charge the weaponry efficiently.
